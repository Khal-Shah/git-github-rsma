First create remote repo on github (soen341, already done)
Create a folder on your computer where you wanna keep the files.

initialize local repository (your computer) with: terminal ==> 'cd path_name_of_folder git init'
After creating local repo, link it so you can pull all the files/changes from remote repo:

•Use 'git add origin <link>' to add remote repo
•Pull files with 'git pull'
•Push your own changes into central repo with 'git push'
