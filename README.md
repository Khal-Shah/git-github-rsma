First create remote repo on github (soen341, already done)

Create a folder on your computer where you wanna keep the files.

initialize local repository (your computer) with: terminal ==> 'cd path_name_of_folder git init'

After creating local repo, link it (to online repo on github) so you can pull all the files/changes from remote repo:

•Use command 'git remote add origin "link_address"' to add remote repo...the link can be found on the github repo ("Clone or Download" buttoon).

•Pull files with command 'git pull'
ex: 'git pull origin master' (will fetch files from remote to local repo)

•Push your own changes into central repo with 'git push'
